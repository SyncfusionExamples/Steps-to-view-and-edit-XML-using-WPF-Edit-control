##  Creating the WPF Edit Control
Start by adding the Syncfusion WPF Edit control to your project. This involves:
- Referencing the required Syncfusion assemblies
- Placing the control in your XAML layout

The control provides features like syntax highlighting, line numbering, and auto-indentation out of the box.

## Configuring as an XML Editor
To enable XML editing capabilities:
- Configure the control’s syntax highlighting and parsing rules to recognize XML structure
- Use Syncfusion’s built-in XML syntax support via configuration or code

This ensures that XML tags, attributes, and values are properly highlighted and formatted.

## Loading XML Files
You can load XML files using standard file I/O operations. Once loaded, the content is displayed with proper formatting, making it easier to read and edit.

## Customizing XML Tags and Content
The editor allows customization of how XML elements are displayed. You can:
- Define styles for tags, attributes, and values
- Enhance readability and visual appeal

This is especially useful for domain-specific XML formats.

## Editing and Saving XML Files
Users can freely edit the XML content within the control. After editing:
- Save the content back to the file system using standard save operations
- Integrate this into your application’s workflow for configuration or data editing

## Use Cases
This approach is ideal for developers building tools such as:
- Configuration managers
- Data editors
- Code utilities

The Syncfusion WPF Edit control offers a rich, customizable experience that enhances productivity and usability.
